## üéØ The Problem

Modern quantum computing education suffers from three critical gaps:

1. **Fragmented Learning** - Quantum computing taught separately from machine learning
2. **High Barriers** - Complex setup requirements, installation dependencies, expensive hardware access
3. **Limited Experimentation** - No easy way to prototype hybrid quantum-classical workflows

**Result:** Students, researchers, and ML practitioners struggle to explore quantum ML concepts hands-on.

---

## üí° Our Solution

**Quantum ML Builder** is a browser-based, zero-installation platform that lets anyone build, simulate, and visualize hybrid quantum-classical machine learning workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

### Key Innovation
We bridge the quantum-classical divide by allowing **quantum circuits to act as feature transformers** for classical ML models‚Äîsomething previously difficult to experiment with without real quantum hardware or complex simulation frameworks.
